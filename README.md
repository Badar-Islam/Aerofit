## **Business Problem**
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

**Product Portfolio:**

- The KP281 is an entry-level treadmill that sells for $1,500.

- The KP481 is for mid-level runners that sell for $1,750.

- The KP781 treadmill is having advanced features that sell for $2,500
